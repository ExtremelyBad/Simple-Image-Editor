# Simple-Image-Editor
Uses PILLOW to add simple edits to image folders

Steps to use:
Create 2 directors; one to hold all photos that need to be edited, and another to hold all photos that have been edited.
Upload all photos to be edited in your first folder.
Run the code and depending on the edits you'd like to make, you can input an int input that will jump to the switch statement to run the edit.
Your edited photos should now be in your second folder.
